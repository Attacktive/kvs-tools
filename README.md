Tools for extracting and archiving koei-tecmo .ktsl2stbin files.

### kvs_extract.py

Extracts individual .kvs or .kns files from a .ktsl2stbin file (so they can be decoded with [vgmstream](https://github.com/losnoco/vgmstream)).

### kvs_archive.py

Archives a folder with .kvs files into a single .ktsl2stbin file (for now only supports AOT2, and seems to be broken in the lastest update).
